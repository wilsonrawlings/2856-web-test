<h2>Building a better Binder</h2>

<p>Our team worked on building a better notebook binder for Super Regionals. This new binder went through many iterations. First we went through using 1/4tg inch wood with a 1/8th inch acrylic back. We didnâ€™t like how thick this was, so we moved to at 1/8th inch wood piece and 1/8th inch piece of acrylic sheet. We had trouble aligning the wood and acrylic and so we had to redo it a few times. When we redid it, we had to clean of the glue and try again. We were not able to bfinish today, but hopefully we can next practice.</p>

<h2>Image Process implementation for the button press</h2>

<p>Isaac and Matt worked on implementing the image processing code that allows our robot to hit the correct beacon in autonomous. After adding this program, we can now start to implement a mechanism to hit the button. For the mechanism, we are going to use a mousepad that will conform to the button. This mousepad will allow us to hit the button without using a mechanism that would have to move to hit the button. We can now just use our preexisting systems to hit it!</p>

<h2>Side Collectors</h2>

<p>Shanti worked on making new side collectors. These new ramps should work better than the old method we had. The old ramps were too squishy and the blocks went under them. These new ramps should be more rigid and allow us to gather blocks.</p>

<h2>Reformatting the Notebook</h2>

<p>Arielle worked today on reformatting the notebook. She is adding a few new formatting changes such as new logos, different fonts, and a new background colors for the task column. She is also working on adding a few new pictures that take up some of the blank space we had. We want to make sure we are using up the blank space and following all the rules.</p>

<h2>New Gear Box</h2>

<p>Samin worked on making our new gear box for the hanging mechanism. We used our lathe and our new hexagonal stock. We turned down the hexagonal stock for a part for our new gear box. This will also prevent our gears from slipping.</p>
