<h2>The modification and end of the Flipping Tank drive</h2>

<p>Today Shanti and Wilson worked on perfecting their flipping tank drive prototype. Wilson and Shanti replace the orange flippers with latex tubing attached with zip ties.</p>

<p>This idea ended up not working, because there was no traction on the ramp, and the latex tubing wasn’t helping.</p>

<p>They are now going to move on from this design.</p>

<h2>Taping the new Field and adding the Zipliners</h2>

<p>Ellie and Robert worked on adding the red and blue tape to the field. This tape is really important because it marks the scoring boxes and the red and blue sides of the field.</p>

<p>Attaching the zipliners proved to be hard, but they were able to get 1 side completely set up! They found that some tweaking needed to get done in order for the zipliners to be fully released when the switch was hit.</p>

<h2>Image Processing for Beacon Color</h2>

<p>Matt made the image processing more precise by adding a larger point cloud. Now it can tell the position (color) of the Res-Q beacon.</p>

<h2>Magnetometer testing</h2>

<p>Today Isaac did testing today with the magnetometer. He found out that we could not reliably use the magnetometer because there would be too much interference with motors. After gathering and plotting the data, he ultimately determined that the motors would need to be 10 inches from the phone in order to work well. In the 18x18x18 sizing cube, this wouldn’t be practical.</p>
