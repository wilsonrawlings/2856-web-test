<h2>Rotary Boys and Girls Club - Robotics Club Visit</h2>

<p>Today Arielle and Robert went to Rotary Club. Robert and Jasmine had gone on October 15th, and after their visit, Rotary Boys and Girls Club decided to start their own robotics club. They use EV3’s and will hopefully be competing this year!</p>

<p>Today Arielle and Robert were able to help the students code and program their robots to move through a maze. Hopefully next time we visit we can bring them the money that we raised during the first competition selling concessions.</p>

<h2>Finishing CAD-ing the robot</h2>

<p>Samin finished CAD-ing the robot. He sent it to PacFab. They said they could probably get it done in aluminum with tubing. We will have it done at some point in the near future!</p>

<h2>Ball collecting mechanism continued</h2>

<p>Today Wilson worked on his Ball Collector mechanism. He worked on building the sides and supports of the collector. He used extruded aluminium to hold the flippers and treads in place.</p>

<h2>Coordinating team costumes</h2>

<p>Robert and Arielle were trying to come up with a team costume. The team decided on buying suspenders. Arielle found some black suspenders on Ebay and they will be in before the next competition! In addition, Arielle found a Tesseract CAD model and began to print Tesseracts for the team!</p>

<h2>Autonomous work</h2>

<p>AJ wrote a custom settings menu. Today, Matt implemented them into the main autonomous code. Now, we can choose a delay for the beginning of autonomous and for what alliance side we are on, without having to choose different op modes. This makes it much more convenient, so we don’t have to have the same code repetitively. Instead, we can select from a comprehensive settings dialogue.</p>

<h2>Climber scoring mechanism</h2>

<p>Peter created a rack and pinion system for the climber scoring mechanism (into the shelter). It has an automatic release at full extension. We can release the climbers without an extra servo, once it extends fully. There weren’t any problems with creating this mechanism.</p>
