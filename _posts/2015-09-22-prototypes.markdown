<h2>Flipping Tank Drive</h2>

<p>Wilson and Shanti worked on modifying and testing their flipping tank drive. They talked about ideas to make the drive better. They continued to research tank drive treads and emailed a company to ask for samples.</p>

<p>The flipping tank drive was able to drive up all the bars, but it still has trouble getting from the floor to the ramp. There isnâ€™t enough traction to do this, so they are continuing to think of ways for the robot to make it to the top by itself.</p>

<h2>Sled Final Testing</h2>

<p>Armon and Peter finished testing their sled design. Their sled design was able to slide down the base from the top. They hope this can make the robot get to the ground faster, but some more testing is need.</p>

<p>They are going to continue to build a better and more solid design (instead of PVC).</p>

<h2>PID control that uses Gyro</h2>

<p>Isaac started getting readings, but he discovered a bug that prevented him from getting them sometimes. He will need to work on his Gyro to fix it.</p>

<h2>GIT presentation for the FTC workshop</h2>

<p>AJ worked on debugging issues in the new platform. He found a joystick recognition problem and worked on fixing. They ended up resetting the phones to factory condition to fix it.</p>
