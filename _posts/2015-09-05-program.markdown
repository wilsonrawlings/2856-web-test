<h2>Programming and Java implementation</h2>

<p>AwesomeDrive: Today AJ and Isaac worked on implementing AwesomeDrive, a program that could replace the tank drive. They wanted to get the feeling of how the programs worked in the new format (Android).</p>

<p>Sensor accessing: Matt worked on getting sensors to work on the Android format. We could move the robot based on whether the button was pressed. Isaac worked on getting access to the phone sensors.</p>

<h2>3D Printing parts for scissor lift</h2>

<p>Samin printed parts for the scissor lift. He is continuing his off season project to get a working scissor lift for the club. This could be used in future seasons if 2856 or any other team needs one.</p>

<h2>New Notebook format presentation.</h2>

<p>Wilson and Robert met with our mentor Willy to discuss this year’s outreach. They worked on planning our outreach events and expanding what we did last year. They thought about visiting middle schools in our area, and discussed a partnership with Jane Adams middle school to help the school’s FLL team.</p>
