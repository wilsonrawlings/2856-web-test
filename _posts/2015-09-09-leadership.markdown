<h2>Leadership Discussion</h2>

<p>Because we are the veteran team, we decided to have a discussion about how leadership on it is going to pan out this year. Robert and Arielle are going to run the engineering notebook on 2856 and coordinate outreach and sponsors for all three teams. This was agreed upon by 2856. 
</p>

<p>We had a long discussion about how accountability is going to work this year. In order to make sure everyone is working on something within their skill set, Gabe raised the idea of having Isaac run the backlog and delegate to the programmers and have Wilson do the same with the builders. We were not able to come up with a complete plan for how this is going to work, but we planned a meeting in a month to check in on how this is working. </p>

<p>Overall, it was really helpful to have this discussion and discuss the pros and cons of the backlog manager idea. The meeting in the future will be very helpful to any problems from this.</p>

<h2>Finish organizational projects</h2>

<p>Arielle and AJ worked on writing down the labels of the bins we haven’t yet finished. This will definitely help us in the future to be able to know where parts are and work more efficiently.</p>

<h2>Finish computer for laser printer</h2>

<p>Armon and Wilson built a computer for the laser printer. Previously, the computer wasn’t in a very good case and it wasn’t safe. The team bought a new case and worked on disassembling and reassembling the computer in the new case.</p>

<p>However, they ran into some problems. For example, the board kept shorting out because the bottom of the motherboard was touching the metal of the case. They put spacers in the computer in order to fix this.</p>

<p>It is now in great working order!</p>
