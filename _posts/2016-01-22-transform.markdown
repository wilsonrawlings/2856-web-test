<h2>Electronics</h2>

<p>The electronics we made yesterday turned out to be too large and in the wrong configuration. This meant today Wilson had to reconfigure them and put them different places. He had to redesign, laser cut, and assemble his new idea. He is now mounting, which has been very difficult given that there is not much space.</p>

<h2>Scoring Mechanism Protection</h2>

<p>We put two new bars on the front of our robot to protect our scoring mechanism from hitting the top bar while we hang. These bars will make sure our scoring doesn’t get damaged in the process of hanging.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Zipliners</h2>

<p>Shanti worked on fixing the zipliner hitters on the side of the robot. These “wings” of the robot fold down to hit the zipliners. These Tetrix wings are a lot stronger than our old flippers which bent backwards. These new zipliner hitters are attached to servos that allow them to fold down once that match starts, letting us still fit in the 18x18x18 sizing cube.</p>

<h2>Coming a long ways</h2>

<p>Over today’s practice, we have made some incredible progress, some of the best we have ever made. We added our electronics, a mechanism to keep the scoring mechanism secure, zip line hitters, a metal debris blocker, attaching the debris scorer and hanging mechanism.</p>
