        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Poster and branding for Super Regionals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson, Arielle, Ellie, and Willy worked on finishing the poster and business cards for Super Regionals. They want to make a cohesive theme throughout all of it, so they picked the best color for a tesseract and are putting our name on everything. They are working on pit decorations, like planning on folding cubes to put over Christmas lights to decorate. They also increased our social media presence by creating a Snapchat and an Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Matt: Basic maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt replaced the servo for the hang lock because the wire was broken. He also did more testing for static and debugged a motor controller that wasn’t connecting. It was the result of a faulty USB cable. This was mostly basic maintenance so that the robot is more reliable and minor problems are gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Researching code problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ helped Isaac and Matt. He researched some problems the coders have with the code base. On the main app screen, it displays errors as they occur, like hardware and Opware errors, but they don’t scroll so the messages cut off. It isn’t possible to change this, so AJ needs to contact FTC for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Samin and Isaac: Basic Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin worked with Matt and Isaac on wiring. This way, things won’t come unplugged as easily. They also replaced some broken servos and made a dispensing mechanism, so blocks are properly funneled into the collection mechanism. They accidentally put the wrong servo on first (a continuous servo), but fixed it fast. Samin will be fixing the back wheel tomorrow by making it smaller so that the robot will fit inside the sizing cube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Autonomous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac worked on making the autonomous more reliable. He mainly did testing and did minor code tweaks. They are thinking about adding a button press because it should be fairly simple, but that will come when we have time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #56</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Fixing our Static Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team worked a lot today on fixing our continued static problem. Our robot has been shutting down when it touches the ramp because of static, so we worked to figure out the problem. Wilson had brought in his dehumidifier and we made the room as dry as possible. We then tested different mechanisms to find out what was making us shut down. We used a van der graft generator from the physics room to shock different parts of the robot to find out what was conducting the most electricity. We have been having lots of trouble with our batteries, and they keep draining very quickly over practice. We weren’t able to fully fix the static or battery problem today, but we are making progress and hopefully can fix it this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Us Disscussing Static.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Designing our Pit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pit design is something that our team finds important. To have an amazing pit, we spent some time brainstorming the setup of our Super Regionals Pit. We are thinking of having a large pack poster that says our team name. We will have two tables: one for our robot and one for outreach and handouts. We will have a cube theme throughout our tent, including cube balloons, candy, handouts, and more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post56-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pit&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;1st Pit Design.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Phone Box and Organizer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert worked on building a phone holding box. This box will have a foam interior that holds our team’s phones and charges them. The two holes on the sides of the box is where the charger cords go to plug into a wall outlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new phone box will allow us to have better organization than we have had in the past. Before, our phone were sitting on a cart, and the cords got very tangled. We now have a better system for keeping them organize and tidy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up the Pit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked on setting up our PBC pit and making sure that our set up from last year would work. We started to plan out posters we would make and how our tables would be set up. We discussed the best use of our space and how we wanted to organize it this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post55-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pit&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Setting Up The Pit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Replacing the Polycarbonate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter worked on replacing the polycarbonate belt of the scoring mechanisms. We decided to replace it to make it more robuts to make sure it is not going to fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also working on modifying this mechanism because we want to make it more efficient and faster. We want it to be faster at scoring so that we can do more trips of blocks. Our changes should also make it less prone to jamming, which has been a problem in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post55-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;poly&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The Side of The Robot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Order Acrylic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on ordering acrylic for our notebook. This acrylic would be used to make the top of our notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Budget Talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team also worked to talk about our budget. We decided what we were going to buy for Super Regionals. We decided we wanted to spend some money buying new posters, Tesseract balloons, and more cube-related items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Decompiling (hopefully)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the FTC app, there is source code and compiled code. We don’t have the source code for the compiled code. AJ and Matt are trying to decompile the binary so they can modify it. They tried variations of two basic approaches: decompiling the binary, modifying it, and recompiling it or decompiling it and integrating it back into the main source tree. Nothing has worked so far. In the future, they hope to get it to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post55-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;code&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Coders Working Away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Restart the robot through code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac is making a program that lets the driver communicate with the inner workings of the robot through opmodes. The goal is to eventually be able to restart the robot through opmodes. So, if there is an error, we can restart the robot. He is tweaking the socket, which is an internet connection within a device. He is sending data back and forth through that. He is not done yet, but he has gotten data sending, so he is close. This is in addition to AJ and Matt’s project. They are making changes deeper than the code and Isaac wants to be able to communicate deeper in the code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If AJ and Matt do not figure out how to do their project. we can do simple things like restart the robot, but it won’t be as complex as we want.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #54</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Static Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team realized that static electricity was really important to understand for Super Regionals. If we continue to not address this problem, our robot could repeat its State performance and not work again, which could be fatal at Super Regionals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti and Armon’s task was to research what static electricity we create. They needed to find the materials that rub against each other on our robot. They were figuring out where the materials are located on the Triboelectric Scale. They found almost everything. They found that the polyurethane is really high on the scale, while most of the other materials are really low on the scale. They’ve contacted the company to figure out what the rubber part of the treads are made of, because they don’t know yet and it is important to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the polyurethane is high on the scale, it could potentially be creating static electricity on the robot. Depending on what material the rubber on the treads is made out of, it could be another potential source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post54-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;word&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Word Doc List.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Custom axle making for block collecting and scoring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter and Samin decided to make the treadmill faster. This will allow us to score faster and the blocks won’t jam in the treadmill system. Peter is using a custom sprocket, but the axle hole is too big. They got a bigger axle and turned down most of the axle to fit a normal axle size, except for a little part of it to fit the new sprocket. Peter is putting the chain on right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ball scorer used to be a 2:1 gear ratio. With the new little sprocket, it is a 4:1 ratio. They changed another sprocket to an even bigger one, 8:1, so it will be 8 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post54-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sprocket&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Scorer Sprocket..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overriding error messages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac is looking through the FTC code. He is finding a way to change the configuration files, mid-match, in order to deal with the interface module being broken. If one device dies, it will stop that one device, but the rest of the robot will continue working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hasn’t been working very well. The software is confusing. A lot of the code is also compiled, for no visible reason. It doesn’t have to be compiled, but it is, so a lot of it is unreadable. He is stopping the error reporting idea, but he’s still trying to change the config between autonomous and teleop. According to Larry, the two things most prone to static are the interface module and the legacy module, which are only used in autonomous. If we can eliminate them for teleop, our problems could be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Larry Ryan visit - static conversation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Larry Ryan came over to our Robotics Dungeon to talk to us about static build up. Due to the effect that static had on our performance at our last competition, so we wanted to solve this problem as soon as possible. Larry Ryan was a mentor for our Robotics Club in the past, where he helped us solve many of our electrical problems. When he came to our Dungeon he gave a presentation on how static  is built up between two materials, and his speculation on what could be the problem. After seeing our robot he said that we were asking for static shortages, because of our mounting of our electronics. We are going to research the TriboElectic Series to find out what materials are producing the most amount of static, and figure out a way to disperse that static. I hate Larry jk he’s the best I owe him money he doesn&#39;t know it though. I realise that this is irrelevant, but Ima say it anyways. I stole Larry’s NASA Suit from his 1994 space expedition. I stole it because I wanted it, and it also looked fly as fish. Larry doesn’t know about this though, but I’m saying it now because I broke it when I attempted to land on Mars. Technically my red panda, Mark, broke it, but I will take the blame cause he is too damn cute. Getting that out of the way, during his presentation, Larry showed us a TriboElectric Scale showing how different materials react to each other. The scale showed that materials at opposite sides of the scale will create more static than materials that are closer together on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Super Regional Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team has many ideas for Super Regionals. Gabe made us take a week off to think and we came together on Wednesday to discuss. We all wanted to start talking, but instead, Gabe had us write down what we wanted. This was everything from fixing the static to improving the ball collector to making the pit and improving the engineering notebook. Then, we found that everyone had too many ideas! Gabe had everyone take 5 sticky notes and place them next to the ideas we found important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We narrowed our priorities down to drive practice, gearbox, block collector, static, pit, outreach, wiring, and code. These will be flexible as we run into problems, like foreseeable problems with the code or realizing we have to fix static first. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Anti-Slip Hanging Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had two methods for helping our hang. We had trouble because our new gear ratio (which allows us to hang faster) could not hold our robot up. These two methods were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.	a second hook that extends to help us hold on. This hook would not be on a tape measure but would instead latch on once the tape measure has finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.	a pin system that would stop the tape measure for slipping. This pin system would slide into the tape measure spool, using a servo, and stop the spool from unwinding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post51-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rex&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Hang Spool Pin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Debris Collectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti made two debris collectors that guided the locks into the block collector mechanism. These collectors allow us to gather blocks much easier. We now should be able to gather five blocks more efficiently, hopefully letting us make more trips to the top of the mountain to score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post51-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;corral&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Collectors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Testing, testing, testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We did quite a bit of testing to make sure that our block collector, scoring, and hanging could work properly. Since we redid the chassis, we have to do a lot of testing to make sure our mechanisms work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Remaking the Block dumpers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti also worked on remaking the block dumpers. The old block dumper ramps got the blocks stuck between the conveyor belt and the ramp. We wanted to remake them to make sure the blocks had a smooth transition into the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post51-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dumpers&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Chassis finalization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone worked on finishing mounting all of the mechanisms. They moved the treads around to fix things, and replaced the drive train gears with a chain because it&#39;s way more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post50-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chassis&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Wiring on Chassis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Code tuning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Isaac worked on code for the new chassis. They calibrated all of the servo values and ensured that all the configuration files were correct now that the new chassis is put together. Isaac also converted our old autonomous to the new chassis, although he didn&#39;t have time to test it, and he added a couple new features to teliop to support new mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post50-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;isaac&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Isaac Working on Code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson, Samin and Isaac finished mounting the electronics. They then did some testing and fixed some problems with the organization of the wiring, since some wires were catching on parts of the robots. They also found new spots for some of the motor controllers. At the end of practice, Peter replaced the backbrace motor, which seemed to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Battery mount&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt made a battery mount for the chassis. This allowed us to mount the battery in an out-of-the-way place on the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electronics we made yesterday turned out to be too large and in the wrong configuration. This meant today Wilson had to reconfigure them and put them different places. He had to redesign, laser cut, and assemble his new idea. He is now mounting, which has been very difficult given that there is not much space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scoring Mechanism Protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put two new bars on the front of our robot to protect our scoring mechanism from hitting the top bar while we hang. These bars will make sure our scoring doesn’t get damaged in the process of hanging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zipliners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti worked on fixing the zipliner hitters on the side of the robot. These “wings” of the robot fold down to hit the zipliners. These Tetrix wings are a lot stronger than our old flippers which bent backwards. These new zipliner hitters are attached to servos that allow them to fold down once that match starts, letting us still fit in the 18x18x18 sizing cube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coming a long ways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over today’s practice, we have made some incredible progress, some of the best we have ever made. We added our electronics, a mechanism to keep the scoring mechanism secure, zip line hitters, a metal debris blocker, attaching the debris scorer and hanging mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Adding the Scoring Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin and Peter worked on adding the scoring mechanism. The ended up having to change the height, size, and dimensions of the scoring mechanism. They had to change all of this to make if fit the new chassis. This proved to take a lot of time, but today they finally got it on. Now they are working changing the size of the motor mount so it fits the new scoring mechanism. They are trying to get it motorized, and they are very close. They changed the length to avoid blocks jamming. They also redid the gearing to make the gears a better fit. After this, they hope to add the scoring mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on making the motor controllers and electronics. He designed the mount on Solidworks and printing before finally putting it all together. He used the new nylon screws to keep it together. We are doing new plastic screws to reduce static shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may need to redesign this system if we have to move it to make room for the tape measure mechanism, which we had trouble finding room for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Poster Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willy, Arielle, and Robert worked on putting together posters for state. They decided what sections would be on each of the four posters (chassis, mechanisms, coding, and outreach). They created a format that they would use on all the posters, and they hope to finish and print these soon so they can get them for state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we are putting together pictures and information before formatting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mounting the block Dumper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The block dumper is finally getting put on! Our team worked hard today to make room for the block dumper, which we have been excited to add. The block dumper was not on our old robot, so it will be awesome to finally be able to score blocks. The block dumper design started many months ago when Robert and Arielle worked on a conveyor idea to score blocks on either side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac and Matt worked on mounting the block scoring mechanism. They attached the block scorer to two pieces of 20x20 extrusion. This allows the scoring mechanism to be adjustable as we try to figure out the best height for scoring blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding the Tape Measure Hanging System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to be using the same tape measure as we used on the last chassis. We cut off 3 feet of tape from the mechanism to make sure we had a strong part that could let us hang reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac, Matt, and Samin worked to make the mechanism more secure and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hoping to add this to the robot soon, however, we want to work on adding the other important mechanisms first. We had a lot of trouble finding room for the mechanism, however, we finally think we found a spot above the cube dumper. Hopefully we can fit all of our desired mechanisms!&lt;/p&gt;
