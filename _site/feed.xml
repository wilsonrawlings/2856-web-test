        <description>&lt;h2&gt;The modification and end of the Flipping Tank drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Shanti and Wilson worked on perfecting their flipping tank drive prototype. Wilson and Shanti replace the orange flippers with latex tubing attached with zip ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea ended up not working, because there was no traction on the ramp, and the latex tubing wasn’t helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are now going to move on from this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Taping the new Field and adding the Zipliners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellie and Robert worked on adding the red and blue tape to the field. This tape is really important because it marks the scoring boxes and the red and blue sides of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching the zipliners proved to be hard, but they were able to get 1 side completely set up! They found that some tweaking needed to get done in order for the zipliners to be fully released when the switch was hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post5-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zipliner mount&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The Zipliners Mounted to the Top of the Mountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image Processing for Beacon Color&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt made the image processing more precise by adding a larger point cloud. Now it can tell the position (color) of the Res-Q beacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Magnetometer testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Isaac did testing today with the magnetometer. He found out that we could not reliably use the magnetometer because there would be too much interference with motors. After gathering and plotting the data, he ultimately determined that the motors would need to be 10 inches from the phone in order to work well. In the 18x18x18 sizing cube, this wouldn’t be practical.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #4</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Flipping Tank Drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Shanti worked on modifying and testing their flipping tank drive. They talked about ideas to make the drive better. They continued to research tank drive treads and emailed a company to ask for samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flipping tank drive was able to drive up all the bars, but it still has trouble getting from the floor to the ramp. There isn’t enough traction to do this, so they are continuing to think of ways for the robot to make it to the top by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post4-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tank on mountain&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Shanti Next To Flippin Tank Drive on Top Of The Mountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sled Final Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Peter finished testing their sled design. Their sled design was able to slide down the base from the top. They hope this can make the robot get to the ground faster, but some more testing is need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are going to continue to build a better and more solid design (instead of PVC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post4-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sled tank&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Testing out The Sled Chassis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PID control that uses Gyro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac started getting readings, but he discovered a bug that prevented him from getting them sometimes. He will need to work on his Gyro to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GIT presentation for the FTC workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ worked on debugging issues in the new platform. He found a joystick recognition problem and worked on fixing. They ended up resetting the phones to factory condition to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #3</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Chassis Prototype Idea 1: Flippin Tank Drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on prototyping a tank drive chassis with Tetrix tank treads and urethane flippers for traction. He did a preliminary test in the morning after completing one side of the flippers and it seemed to work well, so he continued with the second side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, Wilson did a final tank drive test with both sides of the flippers. He found that getting up the very first part of the ramp is hard because there is no traction. The flipper design was a 1/3 success because it fell apart at places and it wasn’t too great at moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for the flippers is that they will support the robot on the ground as well as let the robot climb the mountain. The mountain is proving to be tricky to climb, however, because the angle change from ground level to the angle of the mountain is large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tank&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Close up View of Flippin Tank Drive.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Wilson Woring On The Field With Flippin Tank Drive.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;hassis Prototype Idea 2: Sled Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Peter worked on a sled design. This idea will help us go down the ramp faster. The sled will work by having two PVC pipes on the sides of the robot be able to come down to act as sled runners to get us back to the floor of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Peter haven’t finished the sled prototype yet, and they are gonna continue to work on it throughout this coming week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;armon working&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Armon Working On The Sled Chassis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Backlog work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked on getting our backlog system up and running. We started writing tasks that we wanted to start working on soon, as well as tasks that were currently in progress. We have different colored slips of paper for each team’s tasks. This year, we want to be able to move tasks along the backlog depending on how close we are to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team’s paper color is orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;backlog&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Our New Colorful Backlog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mill instructions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti and Samin continued to learn how to use the mill. Gerald gave them a lesson for about an hour to make sure they know how to use the mill safely. They practiced by milling a new bracket for a servo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new machining room is a great place for safe machining work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mill lesson&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Samin and Shanti Learning The Ways of The Mill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up New Field (Res-Q)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maddy worked on putting the Res-Q field together. One of the mountains is mostly put together so far. This field proved to be sort of hard to put together, so we will continue it throughout this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our new room, we can have a permanent field set up! In previous years in our old room, we had to set up the field at the beginning of practice if we wanted to use it and then take it down at the end. This took a lot of time out of our practice. This field would have been very hard to move every practice, and so it is great we can have it set up permanently!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the Res-Q field set up soon will also allow us to do great prototype testing like we did today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;field&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Setting up The New Field.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Setting up The New Field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fan Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac continued to work on his ball blowing fan mechanism. The gear ratio was increased by 400%, and he upgraded to a more powerful AndyMark motor. It was much more effective, and all the balls were blown out of the cube cluster at a distance of approximately two feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design will be helpful because we plan to only collect cubes for this game because it is a more efficient scoring item (more can fit in each bin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next practice, Isaac hopes to make the mechanism more concentrated by having the fan blow through the tube so balls in front of the robot move out of the way. He will also be CADing this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fan&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Isaac Continues Work On The Fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tread Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santi researched tank treads that we could use for our robot. In her research, she requested a quote from a company that sells tread belts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;High Clearance Chassis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin worked on a chassis that had high clearance that was meant to be able to go over debri on the field. This chassis had large wheels that were supposed to go up the mountain as well. This design ended up not working because the wheels were not big enough to go up the mountain. Samin wasn’t able to finish it today, but he does not plan to finish this prototype because it proved not to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flipper Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ worked on various club level things. He wrote some prototype code for Wilson’s flipper design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ also worked writing some code goals in the backlog. The coders discussed what their priorities were, and how long they thought tasks would take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;aj&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;AJ Coding a Basic OPMode for Wilson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Android phone camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt worked on programming a test application that could retrieve an image from the camera of the Android phone. He is now working on using it to detect what position the button is in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Project Design and Backlog Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duncan’s dad came in to help us with our backlog setup. He is a product manager, so he gave a presentation how to use the backlog while in the design process. Duncan’s father also worked with Maddy to help her set up the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;presentation&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Duncan’s Dad Presenting To Us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Safety Presentation and Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerald gave a safety presentation today regarding the mill, saws, and cutting tools we have. In his presentation, Gerald talked about the importance of not having loose clothing and tying hair back. He also gave some rules for using the room which will help to keep us safe while using these tools to make specialized parts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #2</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;What does the robot need to be able to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first step of our engineering process. As a group, we are figuring out exactly what our goal is, both immediate and final. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goals are what we need to do and time it might take. We are designing to specs. We want to be able to measure when we meet our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be helpful in the future when comparing which prototype is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Room, with SMARTBOARD and Whiteboard with ideas on them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mechanism brainstorm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed to get our ideas on paper. We came up with an idea to build the general chassis and prototype different ways of movement. This is completely new for our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Whiteboard with Mechanism Ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tank tread prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti and Wilson worked on building preliminary tank treads to test. Currently, Tetrix is a pain. The current treads will be very basic. They are in the middle of working on it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are using Tetrix, plastic sprockets and plastic tank treads to test. There wasn’t much time to test, but the one side that had been constructed looked to work fairly well. There is no traction right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next meeting, the other side has to be built and the treads need to be tested more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Whiteboard with Mechanism Ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and AJ worked on the particular elements of image processing that will be needed to identify the beacon in autonomous. In particular, they started work on a program that will be able identify a blue region, isolate all the image processing work to the relevant region of the bitmap, and then identify the black button. While OpenCV is a powerful framework, it seems like it may be overkill for this particular problem. It also suffers from poor documentation, along with the fact that the OpenCV API was obviously ported straight from C, and so retains some idiosyncrasies from C that a native Java API would not force the programmer to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;coders&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Coders Working on Image Processing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prototyping a fan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac did a test by blowing air on the balls and they rolled away well. So, he figured that it could be scaled up and a fan could do the same thing. He began by designing a good gear ratio to spin the fan as fast as possible. The ratio is 9:1. By accident, he geared at backwards so it actually went 9 times slower, but that was easily fixed.
He constructed it by heating some ABS and bending it into a propeller, using Tetrix for speed. He tested on the field and he was able to blow some of the balls, but one of the balls surrounded by a couple cubes would not move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this was the way the ball was on the floor or because it was surrounded needs to be tested in the future. 
He is building another iteration with four times more speed that will hopefully be able to blow balls even when they’re in different orientations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fan&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Game Strategy Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find it helpful to start by planning out how our strategy is going to look this year. 2856 made two goals: our initial and our final goal. Our initial goal is what our robot will be able to do at the first league competition and our final goal is our State/Super Regional robot. This will allow us to create an arc throughout the season. When we are working on our initial robot, that doesn’t have to do much, we will still be on the way to creating our final robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created this strategy by looking at the point values and the low-hanging fruit that everyone will be going for in the first couple matches. From our experience at Super Regionals last year, we know that the robots there can do everything and fast. We found the best way to get as many points as possible. Our team timed out how long it will take us to collect debris and fill up the boxes during Teleop (as seen below). This is what we will shoot for, although there is a little leeway too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Board With Strategy Ideas On It.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wilson’s Birthday!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s mom showed up and told everyone that it is Wilson’s birthday! We sent Wilson and AJ to find a shop-vac in order to divert him and set up the cupcakes with two giant candles in them! After a very long time, they finally came back and everyone sang Wilson happy birthday! And ate cupcakes :-).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preseason Session #5</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Leadership Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are the veteran team, we decided to have a discussion about how leadership on it is going to pan out this year. Robert and Arielle are going to run the engineering notebook on 2856 and coordinate outreach and sponsors for all three teams. This was agreed upon by 2856. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a long discussion about how accountability is going to work this year. In order to make sure everyone is working on something within their skill set, Gabe raised the idea of having Isaac run the backlog and delegate to the programmers and have Wilson do the same with the builders. We were not able to come up with a complete plan for how this is going to work, but we planned a meeting in a month to check in on how this is working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was really helpful to have this discussion and discuss the pros and cons of the backlog manager idea. The meeting in the future will be very helpful to any problems from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finish organizational projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arielle and AJ worked on writing down the labels of the bins we haven’t yet finished. This will definitely help us in the future to be able to know where parts are and work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost5-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paper&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finish computer for laser printer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Wilson built a computer for the laser printer. Previously, the computer wasn’t in a very good case and it wasn’t safe. The team bought a new case and worked on disassembling and reassembling the computer in the new case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they ran into some problems. For example, the board kept shorting out because the bottom of the motherboard was touching the metal of the case. They put spacers in the computer in order to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now in great working order!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that the team knows everything available to us in terms of materials. This will give us the most possibilities when building and programming the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 motors and 12 servos (new approved motors)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring our own controllers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red = +, Black = -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gopros for our own entertainment (only for post match enjoyment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D printed parts are approved if you make them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 degree of freedom limitation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as we can easily buy it, we can basically use anything - planetary gear trains, guide rails, carriages, carbon fiber, elastic fabric, rubber, shrink wrap
&lt;p&gt;Don’t modify electronics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USB surge protector (for static problems?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrite Beads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Research other team’s design processes using engineering notebooks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willy found some of the best engineering notebooks in the world. Our team used them to analyze other team’s design processes and how to replicate them. In addition, we scouted how their notebooks looked and how we can use them for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software prototyping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwaway or evolutionary&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Throw away - learn from it and create a different finished product&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary - create a better product and evolve that into your final&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations - sensors&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use integrated phone sensors (can we use the phone camera?) - color and shape&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical prototyping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build entire robot out of thin wood, went to the first competition with it, then manufactured
Oly Cows did this too, did all competitions with basic robot while the rest of the group was CADing and preparing another robot for January 
One team uses an app to show CAD projects in real life - Edrawings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learning about the mill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAAS Robotics, in addition to having a new space, has some new technology. Gerald used some time today to teach us how the mill works. It’s very interesting and will definitely help us in the next year! We learned how to set it up and what it can be used for (very precise cuts and holes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Programming and Java implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AwesomeDrive: Today AJ and Isaac worked on implementing AwesomeDrive, a program that could replace the tank drive. They wanted to get the feeling of how the programs worked in the new format (Android).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensor accessing: Matt worked on getting sensors to work on the Android format. We could move the robot based on whether the button was pressed. Isaac worked on getting access to the phone sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost3-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;programmers&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Room organization and labeling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Robert continued to label every bin of parts we have. They also set up the new file folders and holders that will hold our rough design ideas and hand drawn sketches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost3-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;labels&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3D Printing parts for scissor lift&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin printed parts for the scissor lift. He is continuing his off season project to get a working scissor lift for the club. This could be used in future seasons if 2856 or any other team needs one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost3-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;samin working&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Notebook format presentation.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Robert met with our mentor Willy to discuss this year’s outreach. They worked on planning our outreach events and expanding what we did last year. They thought about visiting middle schools in our area, and discussed a partnership with Jane Adams middle school to help the school’s FLL team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Organizing bolts and nuts as well as labeling new bin system.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Wilson and Robert worked on labeling all the bins holding the new bolts and nuts we ordered. Yesterday, the new sized bolts arrived. This year, the team is going to be using 6-32, 10-32, and 1/4 - 20 bolts. They sorted the regular and nylock nuts for each of these sizes as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sorting&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Wilson Sorting the Nuts and Bolts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;anging up our tool Pegboard in the back of the room.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the team worked on drawing out where everything will go on the pegboard. Today, Shanti and Caleigh started to hang it! There were some trouble finding the support beams, but they finally were able to mount them. The pegboard hasn&#39;t been hung yet because of this trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fixing the 3D printer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin cleaned out the extruder motor of the 3D printer, redid the wiring, and installed a new stepper extruder. He also replaced the capton tape which was out and needed to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Robotics lab room set up: laser cutter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer for the laser cutter was near the lathe, where metal shaving could ruin it. Our team originally thought it would be helpful to have it near the lathe, but after thinking, we chose to move it to a safer spot. Armon worked on moving the computer to the main room instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning and setting up the new room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time organizing new bolts and nuts. We are labeling small bins to keep them organized throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple groups started the process of hanging the peg boards today. They measured the dimensions and cut sizes for the peg board, and the drill holes on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we start organizing now, it will be beneficial to us in the future because we will know where to find everything. In past years, we have had trouble finding things, especially because we had an unsorted bin. Organization now will help to eliminate this inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will be ongoing for a few weeks as we continue to move in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;empty room.&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Our room as we begin to clean and organize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Programming logistics, Android Studio, MIT AppInventor, disseminate info to others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programmers spent time getting an environment set up. They did some work on equipping the existing red SAAS laptops with the tools we need (namely, Android Studio and VirtualBox with an App Inventor image loaded), but not a lot. Matt did the vast majority of the actual programming work. He got a basic opmode working based on existing example code and started trying to get a from-scratch opmode implementation working. Progress is slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Figure out what we don’t know and what we’ve never done before.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team created a 10-dimensional list of important points to hit when researching design. These include chassis, lifting, manipulators, sensor algorithms, and autonomous algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re reading a lot of books about robots and looking up different design ideas to see if we can find something completely new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not come up with anything because we don’t know the game yet, so we’re not sure what might be helpful. Also, there are a lot of ideas out there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost1-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;list on board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Our 10 deminsional list on a whiteboard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting T-Shirt Cannon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The t-shirt cannon was not raising and the lights were not turning on. Arielle and Shanti looked at the wiring and decided to test each part to see if it was working. They started as close to the beginning of the wiring as possible. They tested the double solenoid and realized it was working. They had to go closer. Then, they tested the solenoids with a different cylinder and the new cylinder worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, once they replaced the cylinder, the cannon would drive up but not down. In the future, they need to fix this and the LEDs along the side of the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
