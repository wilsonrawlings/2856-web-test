        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Programming and Java implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AwesomeDrive: Today AJ and Isaac worked on implementing AwesomeDrive, a program that could replace the tank drive. They wanted to get the feeling of how the programs worked in the new format (Android).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensor accessing: Matt worked on getting sensors to work on the Android format. We could move the robot based on whether the button was pressed. Isaac worked on getting access to the phone sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;oom organization and labeling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Robert continued to label every bin of parts we have. They also set up the new file folders and holders that will hold our rough design ideas and hand drawn sketches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3D Printing parts for scissor lift&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin printed parts for the scissor lift. He is continuing his off season project to get a working scissor lift for the club. This could be used in future seasons if 2856 or any other team needs one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Notebook format presentation.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Robert met with our mentor Willy to discuss this year’s outreach. They worked on planning our outreach events and expanding what we did last year. They thought about visiting middle schools in our area, and discussed a partnership with Jane Adams middle school to help the school’s FLL team.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Organizing bolts and nuts as well as labeling new bin system.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Wilson and Robert worked on labeling all the bins holding the new bolts and nuts we ordered. Yesterday, the new sized bolts arrived. This year, the team is going to be using 6-32, 10-32, and 1/4 - 20 bolts. They sorted the regular and nylock nuts for each of these sizes as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;anging up our tool Pegboard in the back of the room.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the team worked on drawing out where everything will go on the pegboard. Today, Shanti and Caleigh started to hang it! There were some trouble finding the support beams, but they finally were able to mount them. The pegboard hasn&#39;t been hung yet because of this trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fixing the 3D printer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin cleaned out the extruder motor of the 3D printer, redid the wiring, and installed a new stepper extruder. He also replaced the capton tape which was out and needed to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Robotics lab room set up: laser cutter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer for the laser cutter was near the lathe, where metal shaving could ruin it. Our team originally thought it would be helpful to have it near the lathe, but after thinking, we chose to move it to a safer spot. Armon worked on moving the computer to the main room instead.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preseason Session #1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Cleaning and setting up the new room&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent some time organizing new bolts and nuts. We are labeling small bins to keep them organized throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple groups started the process of hanging the peg boards today. They measured the dimensions and cut sizes for the peg board, and the drill holes on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we start organizing now, it will be beneficial to us in the future because we will know where to find everything. In past years, we have had trouble finding things, especially because we had an unsorted bin. Organization now will help to eliminate this inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project will be ongoing for a few weeks as we continue to move in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;empty room.&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Our room as we begin to clean and organize.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Programming logistics, Android Studio, MIT AppInventor, disseminate info to others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programmers spent time getting an environment set up. They did some work on equipping the existing red SAAS laptops with the tools we need (namely, Android Studio and VirtualBox with an App Inventor image loaded), but not a lot. Matt did the vast majority of the actual programming work. He got a basic opmode working based on existing example code and started trying to get a from-scratch opmode implementation working. Progress is slow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Figure out what we don’t know and what we’ve never done before.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team created a 10-dimensional list of important points to hit when researching design. These include chassis, lifting, manipulators, sensor algorithms, and autonomous algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re reading a lot of books about robots and looking up different design ideas to see if we can find something completely new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might not come up with anything because we don’t know the game yet, so we’re not sure what might be helpful. Also, there are a lot of ideas out there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Our 10 deminsional list on a whiteboard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting T-Shirt Cannon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The t-shirt cannon was not raising and the lights were not turning on. Arielle and Shanti looked at the wiring and decided to test each part to see if it was working. They started as close to the beginning of the wiring as possible. They tested the double solenoid and realized it was working. They had to go closer. Then, they tested the solenoids with a different cylinder and the new cylinder worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, once they replaced the cylinder, the cannon would drive up but not down. In the future, they need to fix this and the LEDs along the side of the mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
