        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Chassis finalization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone worked on finishing mounting all of the mechanisms. They moved the treads around to fix things, and replaced the drive train gears with a chain because it&#39;s way more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post50-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chassis&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Wiring on Chassis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Code tuning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Isaac worked on code for the new chassis. They calibrated all of the servo values and ensured that all the configuration files were correct now that the new chassis is put together. Isaac also converted our old autonomous to the new chassis, although he didn&#39;t have time to test it, and he added a couple new features to teliop to support new mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post50-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;isaac&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Isaac Working on Code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson, Samin and Isaac finished mounting the electronics. They then did some testing and fixed some problems with the organization of the wiring, since some wires were catching on parts of the robots. They also found new spots for some of the motor controllers. At the end of practice, Peter replaced the backbrace motor, which seemed to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Battery mount&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt made a battery mount for the chassis. This allowed us to mount the battery in an out-of-the-way place on the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #49</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electronics we made yesterday turned out to be too large and in the wrong configuration. This meant today Wilson had to reconfigure them and put them different places. He had to redesign, laser cut, and assemble his new idea. He is now mounting, which has been very difficult given that there is not much space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scoring Mechanism Protection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We put two new bars on the front of our robot to protect our scoring mechanism from hitting the top bar while we hang. These bars will make sure our scoring doesn’t get damaged in the process of hanging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Zipliners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti worked on fixing the zipliner hitters on the side of the robot. These “wings” of the robot fold down to hit the zipliners. These Tetrix wings are a lot stronger than our old flippers which bent backwards. These new zipliner hitters are attached to servos that allow them to fold down once that match starts, letting us still fit in the 18x18x18 sizing cube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coming a long ways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over today’s practice, we have made some incredible progress, some of the best we have ever made. We added our electronics, a mechanism to keep the scoring mechanism secure, zip line hitters, a metal debris blocker, attaching the debris scorer and hanging mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Adding the Scoring Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin and Peter worked on adding the scoring mechanism. The ended up having to change the height, size, and dimensions of the scoring mechanism. They had to change all of this to make if fit the new chassis. This proved to take a lot of time, but today they finally got it on. Now they are working changing the size of the motor mount so it fits the new scoring mechanism. They are trying to get it motorized, and they are very close. They changed the length to avoid blocks jamming. They also redid the gearing to make the gears a better fit. After this, they hope to add the scoring mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post48-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;score&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The Scoring Mechanism on the Chassis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Electronics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on making the motor controllers and electronics. He designed the mount on Solidworks and printing before finally putting it all together. He used the new nylon screws to keep it together. We are doing new plastic screws to reduce static shock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may need to redesign this system if we have to move it to make room for the tape measure mechanism, which we had trouble finding room for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post48-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;electronics&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Electronics Mounted On PolyCarb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Poster Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willy, Arielle, and Robert worked on putting together posters for state. They decided what sections would be on each of the four posters (chassis, mechanisms, coding, and outreach). They created a format that they would use on all the posters, and they hope to finish and print these soon so they can get them for state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now we are putting together pictures and information before formatting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post48-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;peopel&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Designing Posters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mounting the block Dumper&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The block dumper is finally getting put on! Our team worked hard today to make room for the block dumper, which we have been excited to add. The block dumper was not on our old robot, so it will be awesome to finally be able to score blocks. The block dumper design started many months ago when Robert and Arielle worked on a conveyor idea to score blocks on either side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac and Matt worked on mounting the block scoring mechanism. They attached the block scorer to two pieces of 20x20 extrusion. This allows the scoring mechanism to be adjustable as we try to figure out the best height for scoring blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post48-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;scorer&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Block Scorer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding the Tape Measure Hanging System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to be using the same tape measure as we used on the last chassis. We cut off 3 feet of tape from the mechanism to make sure we had a strong part that could let us hang reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac, Matt, and Samin worked to make the mechanism more secure and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are hoping to add this to the robot soon, however, we want to work on adding the other important mechanisms first. We had a lot of trouble finding room for the mechanism, however, we finally think we found a spot above the cube dumper. Hopefully we can fit all of our desired mechanisms!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #47</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Improving the hanging mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac and Matt worked on the new hanging mechanism. They did some tests earlier and found that a 2:1 gear ratio is needed, not an 8:1 ratio. This means we can move the hanging mechanism faster and it takes less time. They redesigned a smaller gearbox for it today. It’s about twice as compact as the old version and will hang the robot 4 times as fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They used a spring force gauge and hooked up a 60:1 motor and pulled a string. This way, they found that alone would exert enough torque to pull the weight of our entire robot up. For safety, they decided to use a 2:1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also added a servo to the hanging mechanism so we can adjust the angle. Now, we no longer have the use the back brace to adjust it and we can move the tape measure’s angle much slower, so it won’t break. Isaac is writing code for that currently. Their future plan is to mount it on the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post47-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hang&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Working on the Hang Mechanism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Resized the ball collector&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter resized the ball collector. He drilled new holes so that it would be higher up. It has to be higher up so we can fit scoring mechanism higher up, so it scores correctly. The gears aren’t meshing well, so Peter is working on fixing it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post47-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;collector&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Ball Collector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Better zipliner trigger&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin and Armon made a mechanism to trigger the zipliners. This is similar to the King’s mechanism, in that it folds down and works reliably. It will work better than our current mechanism because it will be able to get the third zipliner and generally be more reliable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post47-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zipliner&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;New Zipliner Trigger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Adding second motor to drive train&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Samin added a second motor to each side of the drive train for extra torque. Wilson also labeled sides of the robot and is prepared to do the electronics after everything has been mounted. Labeling the sides helps communicate which motors are plugged into where, helps communication between the drivers, and allows the judges to understand our robot better. His last point: it’s fun :-).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post47-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;brace&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Back Brace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Replaced back wheel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin replaced the back wheel with a different back wheel. It is a ninja-flex 3D printed back wheel. It is the same idea as our old treads, but works better repurposed for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post47-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wheel&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Back Brace Wheel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Engineering notebook fixing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the notebook did well at Interleague, that does not mean it is done. Arielle worked on fixing formatting problems, revising and editing, and organized it in such a way that computer page numbering will be easier. In addition, she added all the daily logs to the table of contents for the sake of ease of reading. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Work on the Autonomous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac worked on upgrading our phone to the new Motorola phone. He also made a new laser printed case for it because the other did not fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also spent time working on fine tuning the autonomous. He made corrections and made it simpler from a coder’s standpoint. He did a few tests and was able to score more points by climbing the mountain. At its best it scores 15 points above what it used to score because now it goes to the high zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post41-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;chassis&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;2856 Sitting on the shelf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Binder Work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson researched fundraising ideas. He thought of making luggage tags that our team could sell. These would be red and white, and have our logo on them. He also worked on making our binder and adding the rings. Our binder is now ready for us to add the paper material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post41-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;binder&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The Wood Binder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cube collector to Cube distributer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter worked on the juncture between the cube collector and cube distributer. He also worked on adding stuff to our new Pac Fab chassis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post41-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;collector&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Block Collector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Python practice and Powering the Mechanisms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti worked on learning Python. She went through tutorials as well as doing a challenge that Isaac made for her to teach her more about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She also worked on the movement between the collector and dumper. She then figured out how to power both the mechanisms with one motor.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #40</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Engineering notebook writing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the break, everyone was supposed to work on essays for the notebook. However, because everyone was busy, this didn’t really happen. We didn’t have a lot to work on today, so the whole team wrote most of their essays for the notebook. Samin wrote about hanging and worked on writing about the chassis, Shanti and Peter worked on writing about the scoring mechanism, and AJ revised what Isaac did for code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will make sure the judges see an evolution of our robot and it will all be in one spot, making it easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this, Arielle revised and edited notebook posts that were already written and worked on posters. She also spoke with Willy about judging ideas, like using STAR to be a tagline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post40-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;aj&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;AJ Writing Essays For The Notebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Faster autonomous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac worked on making the autonomous faster. He suspects that in the league match, some robots will run blocking programs. The autonomous raises and lowers the back brace while it’s moving. It also sets the robot speed to 100%. This makes the autonomous take about 15 seconds instead of 30. He has also fixed some other bugs in the code. The second half of the day was spent getting the Motorola phone to work. He’s gotten small pieces of code running on it, but not the full autonomous program - the initialize routine works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’s tested it with blocks and there seems to be no effect. It might be more susceptible to getting blocks under it, but in terms of accuracy, it seems to work well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pacfab chassis!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chassis that Pacfab waterjet and welded for us finally arrived! We were so excited. Samin and Peter got a start on putting the gearbox on it. They filed down a little bit to fit the gear. We’re refraining from making large changes until Gerald is around to supervise. This chassis will not be used for interleague, but instead for state. Our current robot is already very good and reliable enough to use. We will not be taking it apart for the new chassis so we have a backup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Rotary Boys and Girls Club - Robotics Club Visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Arielle and Robert went to Rotary Club. Robert and Jasmine had gone on October 15th, and after their visit, Rotary Boys and Girls Club decided to start their own robotics club. They use EV3’s and will hopefully be competing this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Arielle and Robert were able to help the students code and program their robots to move through a maze. Hopefully next time we visit we can bring them the money that we raised during the first competition selling concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;visit&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finishing CAD-ing the robot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin finished CAD-ing the robot. He sent it to PacFab. They said they could probably get it done in aluminum with tubing. We will have it done at some point in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ball collecting mechanism continued&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Wilson worked on his Ball Collector mechanism. He worked on building the sides and supports of the collector. He used extruded aluminium to hold the flippers and treads in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;robor&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coordinating team costumes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert and Arielle were trying to come up with a team costume. The team decided on buying suspenders. Arielle found some black suspenders on Ebay and they will be in before the next competition! In addition, Arielle found a Tesseract CAD model and began to print Tesseracts for the team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3d printer&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;3D Printing Costumes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Autonomous work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ wrote a custom settings menu. Today, Matt implemented them into the main autonomous code. Now, we can choose a delay for the beginning of autonomous and for what alliance side we are on, without having to choose different op modes. This makes it much more convenient, so we don’t have to have the same code repetitively. Instead, we can select from a comprehensive settings dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;robot and isaac&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Climber scoring mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter created a rack and pinion system for the climber scoring mechanism (into the shelter). It has an automatic release at full extension. We can release the climbers without an extra servo, once it extends fully. There weren’t any problems with creating this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Ball Collector Working!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Shanti finished building the prototype of the cube collector. They tested it and it worked beautifully! They were able to pick up blocks with speed and agility. Now, Wilson is working on making the final version. He will change the size by making it smaller in every direction. He will also change the material. Before it was made out of Tetrix, and now it will be made out of 20x20 extrusion. We will keep the Tetrix belt and urethane flippers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Going through 2856 box&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabe noticed that a lot of parts were going missing. He tasked each team with cleaning out the box of mechanisms and prototypes, because a lot of the materials in there were not being used and could be put back in their respective places. For the beginning of practice, the team went through their box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took apart everything we didn’t need. The more interesting prototypes were put to the side to save for judging or to take photos of. Because we all worked together, this didn’t take nearly as long as we thought it would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post33-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mess&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Autonomous work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac and Matt worked on perfecting the autonomous. They are working hard to get past the debris. They modified their center block tunnel and replaced it with two plows that move all the blocks from out under the treads. Right now they are just cardboard, but if they work, we are hoping to use polycarbonate or metal for these plows. Their largest problem right now is just moving debris so that they can line up with the correct color of the beacon and score the climbers. The autonomous is working great right now, we are just having trouble with the debris getting in the way. Once we get rid of the debris blockage, we will use our PID movement libraries to get to the beacon and image processing to determine the position of the beacon. All of these programs work great then debris is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post33-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;auto&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Continuing to finish notebook cover &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the notebook finished printing, Wilson printed blue plastic to fill in the shapes. In order to keep them in, Wilson and Robert put hot glue on the backs of them. They used a heat gun to melt the glue and spread it around, creating a cool see through effect. Arielle and Robert finished doing this today. All the glue is finished, but the back of the front cover of our notebook has glue all over it and doesn’t look good. In the future, this has to be cleaned. Most likely, they will be putting a paper or duct tape behind the front cover to obscure the glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post33-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;notebook&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CADing the chassis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin finished CAD-ing the chassis. He talked to Gerald about welding the chassis. We will send our CAD-ed file to Pack Fab and have them water jet, mill, and weld the chassis. Samin also worked on redoing some of the wiring on the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Custom settings for Opmode use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ added custom settings for us to use in our Opmode. This includes what side of the field we are on, are we starting close to the ramp or far from the ramp, how many seconds do we wait before executing the Opmode, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did this so the Opmode can deal with different cases on the field. In theory, we would implement this by using more than one Opmode. We’re not going to do that because we would have to scroll through a thousand different Opmodes. 9 Opmodes would do the same thing as this 1, and whenever you changed something, you would have to change everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should show up on the phone, allowing the person using it to click what the conditions are. This program will allow us to do different things on the field without requiring us to write 9 Opmodes or lose one in a sea of others. &lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;New Iteration of the Block Collector Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Shanti worked on the new block collection mechanism. We have been through many iterations, so hopefully this design is the one we chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this design, we use two flippers to lift blocks upward against a moving conveyor on the back of the lift. This design focuses on moving the blocks upward so that we can drop them into the scoring mechanism Peter is making. Shanti and Wilson thought that having a moving conveyor on the back of the block lift would help us move the blocks up without having them fall down the lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;block collector&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Debris track under Robot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Isaac worked on making a mechanism that guides the debris under the robot. We were having problems with stuck debris, so this mechanism should allow us to move across the field without having too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their design had a track under the robot that guides all debris under without getting stuck in the treads. They started this design yesterday, but were able to finish it up today. They did a test where they drove over a large clump of blocks and found their robot glided over them easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;debris guide&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting to the High Zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring out that we needed to be able to get around debris easier, Matt and Isaac made many modifications to the robot. They added 3D printed grippers to the treads. Finally, after switching out a few motors, they were able to do a test to see if we could get to the high zone of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test proved to be incredibly successful! Our robot was able to climb all the way up the mountain to the high zone. Our robot did this incredibly efficiently and in a very short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;isaac with robot&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CADing the Robot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin CADed the robot. He got most of it done, but still has a little left that he can finish by practice Tuesday. This CAD model will be helpful when seeing where we want to add parts to our robot. Samin will then send the CAD to PacFab, and they will print it for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Continuing to build the STAR Program Soccer Chassis #2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert worked on the 2nd soccer robot. This robot will be used to play soccer during the STAR program’s outreach. After this chassis and robot is completed, we will have two robots that kids can use to play soccer against each other. Robert was able to make changes to the chassis and add two wheels to it. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to finish the wheels because we don’t have enough gears for the other two. Robert hopes to continue this project and get it done before 12/8/15, when he, Arielle, and Willy are going to The Bush School to outreach to elementary students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Laser Cutting the Notebook Binder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on making an awesome cover to our engineering notebook. We wanted our notebook to stand out, so Wilson decided that we would making a binder out of thin sheets of wood with a laser cut cover. In the cover, he laser cut 2856, Tesseract, and a Tesseract cube. He added hinges and turned it into a binder that we could use. The final print looks really cool. We are still deciding if it is the binder we are going to use for our final notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;laser&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Laser Cut Items on the Laser Cutter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tread Debris Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Isaac cutout metal shields for our treads. These would help our robot not get stuck on the debris. These blockers were mounted on servos and could raise up when we wanted to climb the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These blockers really helped our robot move efficiently across the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;debris blocker&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Hook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter worked on the hook that our robot uses to attach to the top rung of the mountain. This rack and pinion system that acts as a hook stops us from slipping backward when we raise the back wheel. Normally, the back wheel will stabilize us, but in order to get points for parking in the high zone, we need to raise the back wheel so we are fully in the high zone. The rules say that if we are putting weight in the mid zone, we would not get points for the high zone, only the mid. Our team decided that we wanted to go for high zone points, so Arielle and Robert started the rack and pinion system that keeps us from slipping yesterday and Peter is working on finishing it. He was not able to finish it, so hopefully we can make it a little more study and then put it on the robot soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making the GitHub Sponsor video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ worked on making a sponsor video. A SAAS Alum who works at GitHub will send us cool GitHub stuff like shirts and stickers. In order to get them as a sponsor, we are going to send them a video about how our team uses GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perfecting the Debris Conveyor System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter also worked on perfecting the debris collector. He finished the conveyor part, which is now made out of polyurethane. This new system scores blocks out either side very efficiently. It uses a servo at either end to fold down a dumper. This dumping mechanism allows the blocks to slide away from the robot into the scoring bins, instead of the blocks falling on the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;The modification and end of the Flipping Tank drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Shanti and Wilson worked on perfecting their flipping tank drive prototype. Wilson and Shanti replace the orange flippers with latex tubing attached with zip ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea ended up not working, because there was no traction on the ramp, and the latex tubing wasn’t helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are now going to move on from this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Taping the new Field and adding the Zipliners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellie and Robert worked on adding the red and blue tape to the field. This tape is really important because it marks the scoring boxes and the red and blue sides of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching the zipliners proved to be hard, but they were able to get 1 side completely set up! They found that some tweaking needed to get done in order for the zipliners to be fully released when the switch was hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post5-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zipliner mount&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The Zipliners Mounted to the Top of the Mountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image Processing for Beacon Color&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt made the image processing more precise by adding a larger point cloud. Now it can tell the position (color) of the Res-Q beacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Magnetometer testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Isaac did testing today with the magnetometer. He found out that we could not reliably use the magnetometer because there would be too much interference with motors. After gathering and plotting the data, he ultimately determined that the motors would need to be 10 inches from the phone in order to work well. In the 18x18x18 sizing cube, this wouldn’t be practical.&lt;/p&gt;
