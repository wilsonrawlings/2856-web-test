        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Rotary Boys and Girls Club - Robotics Club Visit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Arielle and Robert went to Rotary Club. Robert and Jasmine had gone on October 15th, and after their visit, Rotary Boys and Girls Club decided to start their own robotics club. They use EV3’s and will hopefully be competing this year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Arielle and Robert were able to help the students code and program their robots to move through a maze. Hopefully next time we visit we can bring them the money that we raised during the first competition selling concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;visit&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finishing CAD-ing the robot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin finished CAD-ing the robot. He sent it to PacFab. They said they could probably get it done in aluminum with tubing. We will have it done at some point in the near future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ball collecting mechanism continued&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Wilson worked on his Ball Collector mechanism. He worked on building the sides and supports of the collector. He used extruded aluminium to hold the flippers and treads in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;robor&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Robot With Ball Collection Mechanism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Coordinating team costumes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert and Arielle were trying to come up with a team costume. The team decided on buying suspenders. Arielle found some black suspenders on Ebay and they will be in before the next competition! In addition, Arielle found a Tesseract CAD model and began to print Tesseracts for the team!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;3d printer&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;3D Printing Costumes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Autonomous work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ wrote a custom settings menu. Today, Matt implemented them into the main autonomous code. Now, we can choose a delay for the beginning of autonomous and for what alliance side we are on, without having to choose different op modes. This makes it much more convenient, so we don’t have to have the same code repetitively. Instead, we can select from a comprehensive settings dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post34-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;robot and isaac&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Isaac Working On The Robot On The Field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Climber scoring mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter created a rack and pinion system for the climber scoring mechanism (into the shelter). It has an automatic release at full extension. We can release the climbers without an extra servo, once it extends fully. There weren’t any problems with creating this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Ball Collector Working!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Shanti finished building the prototype of the cube collector. They tested it and it worked beautifully! They were able to pick up blocks with speed and agility. Now, Wilson is working on making the final version. He will change the size by making it smaller in every direction. He will also change the material. Before it was made out of Tetrix, and now it will be made out of 20x20 extrusion. We will keep the Tetrix belt and urethane flippers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post33-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;collector&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Ball Collector Working!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Going through 2856 box&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gabe noticed that a lot of parts were going missing. He tasked each team with cleaning out the box of mechanisms and prototypes, because a lot of the materials in there were not being used and could be put back in their respective places. For the beginning of practice, the team went through their box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took apart everything we didn’t need. The more interesting prototypes were put to the side to save for judging or to take photos of. Because we all worked together, this didn’t take nearly as long as we thought it would.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post33-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mess&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Us Cleaning Up The Mess in Our Bin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Autonomous work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac and Matt worked on perfecting the autonomous. They are working hard to get past the debris. They modified their center block tunnel and replaced it with two plows that move all the blocks from out under the treads. Right now they are just cardboard, but if they work, we are hoping to use polycarbonate or metal for these plows. Their largest problem right now is just moving debris so that they can line up with the correct color of the beacon and score the climbers. The autonomous is working great right now, we are just having trouble with the debris getting in the way. Once we get rid of the debris blockage, we will use our PID movement libraries to get to the beacon and image processing to determine the position of the beacon. All of these programs work great then debris is not a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post33-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;auto&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Robot On Field Working on Autonomous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Continuing to finish notebook cover &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the notebook finished printing, Wilson printed blue plastic to fill in the shapes. In order to keep them in, Wilson and Robert put hot glue on the backs of them. They used a heat gun to melt the glue and spread it around, creating a cool see through effect. Arielle and Robert finished doing this today. All the glue is finished, but the back of the front cover of our notebook has glue all over it and doesn’t look good. In the future, this has to be cleaned. Most likely, they will be putting a paper or duct tape behind the front cover to obscure the glue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post33-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;notebook&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Cover for new Notebook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CADing the chassis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin finished CAD-ing the chassis. He talked to Gerald about welding the chassis. We will send our CAD-ed file to Pack Fab and have them water jet, mill, and weld the chassis. Samin also worked on redoing some of the wiring on the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Custom settings for Opmode use&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ added custom settings for us to use in our Opmode. This includes what side of the field we are on, are we starting close to the ramp or far from the ramp, how many seconds do we wait before executing the Opmode, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He did this so the Opmode can deal with different cases on the field. In theory, we would implement this by using more than one Opmode. We’re not going to do that because we would have to scroll through a thousand different Opmodes. 9 Opmodes would do the same thing as this 1, and whenever you changed something, you would have to change everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should show up on the phone, allowing the person using it to click what the conditions are. This program will allow us to do different things on the field without requiring us to write 9 Opmodes or lose one in a sea of others. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Session #32</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;New Iteration of the Block Collector Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Shanti worked on the new block collection mechanism. We have been through many iterations, so hopefully this design is the one we chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this design, we use two flippers to lift blocks upward against a moving conveyor on the back of the lift. This design focuses on moving the blocks upward so that we can drop them into the scoring mechanism Peter is making. Shanti and Wilson thought that having a moving conveyor on the back of the block lift would help us move the blocks up without having them fall down the lift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;block collector&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Tetrix Frame For New Block Collector.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Debris track under Robot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Isaac worked on making a mechanism that guides the debris under the robot. We were having problems with stuck debris, so this mechanism should allow us to move across the field without having too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their design had a track under the robot that guides all debris under without getting stuck in the treads. They started this design yesterday, but were able to finish it up today. They did a test where they drove over a large clump of blocks and found their robot glided over them easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;debris guide&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Mounting Place For Debris Management.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting to the High Zone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring out that we needed to be able to get around debris easier, Matt and Isaac made many modifications to the robot. They added 3D printed grippers to the treads. Finally, after switching out a few motors, they were able to do a test to see if we could get to the high zone of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This test proved to be incredibly successful! Our robot was able to climb all the way up the mountain to the high zone. Our robot did this incredibly efficiently and in a very short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;isaac with robot&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Isaac With The Robot On The Field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CADing the Robot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin CADed the robot. He got most of it done, but still has a little left that he can finish by practice Tuesday. This CAD model will be helpful when seeing where we want to add parts to our robot. Samin will then send the CAD to PacFab, and they will print it for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;samin with computer&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Samin Working With His Computer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Continuing to build the STAR Program Soccer Chassis #2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert worked on the 2nd soccer robot. This robot will be used to play soccer during the STAR program’s outreach. After this chassis and robot is completed, we will have two robots that kids can use to play soccer against each other. Robert was able to make changes to the chassis and add two wheels to it. Unfortunately, he wasn’t able to finish the wheels because we don’t have enough gears for the other two. Robert hopes to continue this project and get it done before 12/8/15, when he, Arielle, and Willy are going to The Bush School to outreach to elementary students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;star cassis&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;STAR Program’s 2nd Soccer Chassis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Laser Cutting the Notebook Binder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on making an awesome cover to our engineering notebook. We wanted our notebook to stand out, so Wilson decided that we would making a binder out of thin sheets of wood with a laser cut cover. In the cover, he laser cut 2856, Tesseract, and a Tesseract cube. He added hinges and turned it into a binder that we could use. The final print looks really cool. We are still deciding if it is the binder we are going to use for our final notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;laser&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Laser Cut Items on the Laser Cutter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tread Debris Blocks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and Isaac cutout metal shields for our treads. These would help our robot not get stuck on the debris. These blockers were mounted on servos and could raise up when we wanted to climb the ramp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These blockers really helped our robot move efficiently across the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;debris blocker&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Debris Blocker for Treads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mountain Hook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter worked on the hook that our robot uses to attach to the top rung of the mountain. This rack and pinion system that acts as a hook stops us from slipping backward when we raise the back wheel. Normally, the back wheel will stabilize us, but in order to get points for parking in the high zone, we need to raise the back wheel so we are fully in the high zone. The rules say that if we are putting weight in the mid zone, we would not get points for the high zone, only the mid. Our team decided that we wanted to go for high zone points, so Arielle and Robert started the rack and pinion system that keeps us from slipping yesterday and Peter is working on finishing it. He was not able to finish it, so hopefully we can make it a little more study and then put it on the robot soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;peter&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Peter in the Workshop, Working Away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making the GitHub Sponsor video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ worked on making a sponsor video. A SAAS Alum who works at GitHub will send us cool GitHub stuff like shirts and stickers. In order to get them as a sponsor, we are going to send them a video about how our team uses GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perfecting the Debris Conveyor System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peter also worked on perfecting the debris collector. He finished the conveyor part, which is now made out of polyurethane. This new system scores blocks out either side very efficiently. It uses a servo at either end to fold down a dumper. This dumping mechanism allows the blocks to slide away from the robot into the scoring bins, instead of the blocks falling on the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post32-9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;peter&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;The modification and end of the Flipping Tank drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Shanti and Wilson worked on perfecting their flipping tank drive prototype. Wilson and Shanti replace the orange flippers with latex tubing attached with zip ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea ended up not working, because there was no traction on the ramp, and the latex tubing wasn’t helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are now going to move on from this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Taping the new Field and adding the Zipliners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ellie and Robert worked on adding the red and blue tape to the field. This tape is really important because it marks the scoring boxes and the red and blue sides of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attaching the zipliners proved to be hard, but they were able to get 1 side completely set up! They found that some tweaking needed to get done in order for the zipliners to be fully released when the switch was hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post5-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;zipliner mount&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;The Zipliners Mounted to the Top of the Mountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image Processing for Beacon Color&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt made the image processing more precise by adding a larger point cloud. Now it can tell the position (color) of the Res-Q beacon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Magnetometer testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today Isaac did testing today with the magnetometer. He found out that we could not reliably use the magnetometer because there would be too much interference with motors. After gathering and plotting the data, he ultimately determined that the motors would need to be 10 inches from the phone in order to work well. In the 18x18x18 sizing cube, this wouldn’t be practical.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Flipping Tank Drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson and Shanti worked on modifying and testing their flipping tank drive. They talked about ideas to make the drive better. They continued to research tank drive treads and emailed a company to ask for samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flipping tank drive was able to drive up all the bars, but it still has trouble getting from the floor to the ramp. There isn’t enough traction to do this, so they are continuing to think of ways for the robot to make it to the top by itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post4-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tank on mountain&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Shanti Next To Flippin Tank Drive on Top Of The Mountain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sled Final Testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Peter finished testing their sled design. Their sled design was able to slide down the base from the top. They hope this can make the robot get to the ground faster, but some more testing is need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are going to continue to build a better and more solid design (instead of PVC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post4-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sled tank&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;PID control that uses Gyro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac started getting readings, but he discovered a bug that prevented him from getting them sometimes. He will need to work on his Gyro to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;GIT presentation for the FTC workshop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ worked on debugging issues in the new platform. He found a joystick recognition problem and worked on fixing. They ended up resetting the phones to factory condition to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Chassis Prototype Idea 1: Flippin Tank Drive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson worked on prototyping a tank drive chassis with Tetrix tank treads and urethane flippers for traction. He did a preliminary test in the morning after completing one side of the flippers and it seemed to work well, so he continued with the second side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, Wilson did a final tank drive test with both sides of the flippers. He found that getting up the very first part of the ramp is hard because there is no traction. The flipper design was a 1/3 success because it fell apart at places and it wasn’t too great at moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for the flippers is that they will support the robot on the ground as well as let the robot climb the mountain. The mountain is proving to be tricky to climb, however, because the angle change from ground level to the angle of the mountain is large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tank&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;hassis Prototype Idea 2: Sled Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Peter worked on a sled design. This idea will help us go down the ramp faster. The sled will work by having two PVC pipes on the sides of the robot be able to come down to act as sled runners to get us back to the floor of the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Peter haven’t finished the sled prototype yet, and they are gonna continue to work on it throughout this coming week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Backlog work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked on getting our backlog system up and running. We started writing tasks that we wanted to start working on soon, as well as tasks that were currently in progress. We have different colored slips of paper for each team’s tasks. This year, we want to be able to move tasks along the backlog depending on how close we are to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team’s paper color is orange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;backlog&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Our New Colorful Backlog.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mill instructions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti and Samin continued to learn how to use the mill. Gerald gave them a lesson for about an hour to make sure they know how to use the mill safely. They practiced by milling a new bracket for a servo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our new machining room is a great place for safe machining work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mill lesson&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Samin and Shanti Learning The Ways of The Mill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting up New Field (Res-Q)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maddy worked on putting the Res-Q field together. One of the mountains is mostly put together so far. This field proved to be sort of hard to put together, so we will continue it throughout this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our new room, we can have a permanent field set up! In previous years in our old room, we had to set up the field at the beginning of practice if we wanted to use it and then take it down at the end. This took a lot of time out of our practice. This field would have been very hard to move every practice, and so it is great we can have it set up permanently!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having the Res-Q field set up soon will also allow us to do great prototype testing like we did today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;field&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fan Mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac continued to work on his ball blowing fan mechanism. The gear ratio was increased by 400%, and he upgraded to a more powerful AndyMark motor. It was much more effective, and all the balls were blown out of the cube cluster at a distance of approximately two feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This design will be helpful because we plan to only collect cubes for this game because it is a more efficient scoring item (more can fit in each bin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next practice, Isaac hopes to make the mechanism more concentrated by having the fan blow through the tube so balls in front of the robot move out of the way. He will also be CADing this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fan&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Isaac Continues Work On The Fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tread Research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Santi researched tank treads that we could use for our robot. In her research, she requested a quote from a company that sells tread belts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;High Clearance Chassis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samin worked on a chassis that had high clearance that was meant to be able to go over debri on the field. This chassis had large wheels that were supposed to go up the mountain as well. This design ended up not working because the wheels were not big enough to go up the mountain. Samin wasn’t able to finish it today, but he does not plan to finish this prototype because it proved not to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flipper Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ worked on various club level things. He wrote some prototype code for Wilson’s flipper design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AJ also worked writing some code goals in the backlog. The coders discussed what their priorities were, and how long they thought tasks would take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;aj&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;AJ Coding a Basic OPMode for Wilson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Android phone camera&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt worked on programming a test application that could retrieve an image from the camera of the Android phone. He is now working on using it to detect what position the button is in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Project Design and Backlog Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Duncan’s dad came in to help us with our backlog setup. He is a product manager, so he gave a presentation how to use the backlog while in the design process. Duncan’s father also worked with Maddy to help her set up the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post3-10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;presentation&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Duncan’s Dad Presenting To Us.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Safety Presentation and Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gerald gave a safety presentation today regarding the mill, saws, and cutting tools we have. In his presentation, Gerald talked about the importance of not having loose clothing and tying hair back. He also gave some rules for using the room which will help to keep us safe while using these tools to make specialized parts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h2&gt;What does the robot need to be able to do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first step of our engineering process. As a group, we are figuring out exactly what our goal is, both immediate and final. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goals are what we need to do and time it might take. We are designing to specs. We want to be able to measure when we meet our goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be helpful in the future when comparing which prototype is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Room, with SMARTBOARD and Whiteboard with ideas on them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mechanism brainstorm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We needed to get our ideas on paper. We came up with an idea to build the general chassis and prototype different ways of movement. This is completely new for our team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Whiteboard with Mechanism Ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tank tread prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanti and Wilson worked on building preliminary tank treads to test. Currently, Tetrix is a pain. The current treads will be very basic. They are in the middle of working on it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are using Tetrix, plastic sprockets and plastic tank treads to test. There wasn’t much time to test, but the one side that had been constructed looked to work fairly well. There is no traction right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next meeting, the other side has to be built and the treads need to be tested more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Whiteboard with Mechanism Ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Image processing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt and AJ worked on the particular elements of image processing that will be needed to identify the beacon in autonomous. In particular, they started work on a program that will be able identify a blue region, isolate all the image processing work to the relevant region of the bitmap, and then identify the black button. While OpenCV is a powerful framework, it seems like it may be overkill for this particular problem. It also suffers from poor documentation, along with the fact that the OpenCV API was obviously ported straight from C, and so retains some idiosyncrasies from C that a native Java API would not force the programmer to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;coders&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Coders Working on Image Processing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prototyping a fan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isaac did a test by blowing air on the balls and they rolled away well. So, he figured that it could be scaled up and a fan could do the same thing. He began by designing a good gear ratio to spin the fan as fast as possible. The ratio is 9:1. By accident, he geared at backwards so it actually went 9 times slower, but that was easily fixed.
He constructed it by heating some ABS and bending it into a propeller, using Tetrix for speed. He tested on the field and he was able to blow some of the balls, but one of the balls surrounded by a couple cubes would not move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this was the way the ball was on the floor or because it was surrounded needs to be tested in the future. 
He is building another iteration with four times more speed that will hopefully be able to blow balls even when they’re in different orientations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post2-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;fan&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

        <title>Session #1</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Game Strategy Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find it helpful to start by planning out how our strategy is going to look this year. 2856 made two goals: our initial and our final goal. Our initial goal is what our robot will be able to do at the first league competition and our final goal is our State/Super Regional robot. This will allow us to create an arc throughout the season. When we are working on our initial robot, that doesn’t have to do much, we will still be on the way to creating our final robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created this strategy by looking at the point values and the low-hanging fruit that everyone will be going for in the first couple matches. From our experience at Super Regionals last year, we know that the robots there can do everything and fast. We found the best way to get as many points as possible. Our team timed out how long it will take us to collect debris and fill up the boxes during Teleop (as seen below). This is what we will shoot for, although there is a little leeway too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/post1-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Board With Strategy Ideas On It.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Wilson’s Birthday!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wilson’s mom showed up and told everyone that it is Wilson’s birthday! We sent Wilson and AJ to find a shop-vac in order to divert him and set up the cupcakes with two giant candles in them! After a very long time, they finally came back and everyone sang Wilson happy birthday! And ate cupcakes :-).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preseason Session #5</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Leadership Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are the veteran team, we decided to have a discussion about how leadership on it is going to pan out this year. Robert and Arielle are going to run the engineering notebook on 2856 and coordinate outreach and sponsors for all three teams. This was agreed upon by 2856. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a long discussion about how accountability is going to work this year. In order to make sure everyone is working on something within their skill set, Gabe raised the idea of having Isaac run the backlog and delegate to the programmers and have Wilson do the same with the builders. We were not able to come up with a complete plan for how this is going to work, but we planned a meeting in a month to check in on how this is working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was really helpful to have this discussion and discuss the pros and cons of the backlog manager idea. The meeting in the future will be very helpful to any problems from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finish organizational projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arielle and AJ worked on writing down the labels of the bins we haven’t yet finished. This will definitely help us in the future to be able to know where parts are and work more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost5-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;paper&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finish computer for laser printer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Armon and Wilson built a computer for the laser printer. Previously, the computer wasn’t in a very good case and it wasn’t safe. The team bought a new case and worked on disassembling and reassembling the computer in the new case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, they ran into some problems. For example, the board kept shorting out because the bottom of the motherboard was touching the metal of the case. They put spacers in the computer in order to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now in great working order!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Preseason Session #4</title>
        <description>&lt;h2&gt;Read Section D of the Game Manual&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to make sure that the team knows everything available to us in terms of materials. This will give us the most possibilities when building and programming the robot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 motors and 12 servos (new approved motors)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bring our own controllers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red = +, Black = -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gopros for our own entertainment (only for post match enjoyment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D printed parts are approved if you make them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 degree of freedom limitation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as we can easily buy it, we can basically use anything - planetary gear trains, guide rails, carriages, carbon fiber, elastic fabric, rubber, shrink wrap
&lt;p&gt;Don’t modify electronics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USB surge protector (for static problems?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrite Beads&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img src=&quot;/img/prepost4-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;manual&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot; /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Game Manual Section D.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Research other team’s design processes using engineering notebooks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Willy found some of the best engineering notebooks in the world. Our team used them to analyze other team’s design processes and how to replicate them. In addition, we scouted how their notebooks looked and how we can use them for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software prototyping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwaway or evolutionary&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Throw away - learn from it and create a different finished product&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Evolutionary - create a better product and evolve that into your final&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limitations - sensors&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Use integrated phone sensors (can we use the phone camera?) - color and shape&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical prototyping:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build entire robot out of thin wood, went to the first competition with it, then manufactured
Oly Cows did this too, did all competitions with basic robot while the rest of the group was CADing and preparing another robot for January 
One team uses an app to show CAD projects in real life - Edrawings&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Learning about the mill&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAAS Robotics, in addition to having a new space, has some new technology. Gerald used some time today to teach us how the mill works. It’s very interesting and will definitely help us in the next year! We learned how to set it up and what it can be used for (very precise cuts and holes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
